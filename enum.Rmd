# `Enum` Module

```elixir
Enum.each(
    [1, 2, 3],
    fn (x) -> IO.puts(x) end
)
#> 1
#> 2
#> 3
#> :ok
```

Use the **capture operator** `&` as a shortcut, it takes the full function qualifier — a module name, a function name, and an arity — and turns that function into a lambda that can be assigned to a variable. You can use the capture operator to simplify the call to Enum.each:

```elixir
Enum.each(
    [1, 2, 3],
    &IO.puts/1
)
```
