# Data Types




## (Linked) List

## Map

Whenever you need a key-value store, maps are the “go to” data structure in Elixir. A map is created using the %{} syntax:

```elixir
iex> map = %{:a => 1, 2 => :b}
%{2 => :b, :a => 1}
iex> map[:a]
1
iex> map[2]
:b
iex> map[:c]
nil
```

Compared to keyword lists, we can already see two differences:

- Maps allow any value as a key.

- Maps’ keys do not follow any ordering.

## Keyword List

Keyword lists are lists of **2-item tuples** as the representation of a key-value data structure.

``` elixir
[{:name, "qiushi"}, {:age, 1}]
```

 Elixir supports a special syntax for defining such lists: `[key: value]`. Underneath it maps to the same list of tuples as above.

 ```elixir
[name: "qiushi", age: 1] # shortcut for [{:name, "qiushi"}, {:age, 1}]
 ```

 e can use ++ to add new values to a keyword list:


```elixir
list = [{:a, 1}, {:b, 2}]
list ++ [c: 3]
#> [a: 1, b: 2, c: 3]
[a: 0] ++ list
#> [a: 0, a: 1, b: 2]
```


Many useful functions are available in the `Keyword` module (https://hexdocs.pm/ elixir/Keyword.html). For example, you can use the bracket operator `[]` or `Keyword.get/2` to fetch the value for a key

```elixir
days = [monday: 1, tuesday: 2, wednesday: 3]

days[:monday]
#> 1
Keyword.get(days, :monday)
#> 1
Keyword.get(days, :noday)
#> nil
```

Don’t let that fool you, though. Because you’re dealing with a list, the complexity of a lookup operation is O(n).

Keyword lists are most often useful for allowing clients to pass an arbitrary number of
optional arguments. For example, the result of the function `IO.inspect`, which prints
a string representation of a term to the console, can be controlled by providing addi-
tional options through a keyword list:

```elixir
iex(6)> IO.inspect([100, 200, 300]) # Default behavior
#> [100, 200, 300]
IO.inspect([100, 200, 300], [width: 3]) # passing a keyword list as options
#> [100,
#> 200,
#> 300]
```

In fact, this pattern is so frequent that Elixir allows you to omit the square brackets if the last argument is a keyword list:

```elixir
IO.inspect([100, 200, 300], width: 3, limit: 1)
# pass the second argument as [width: 3, limit: 1]
# not having a third argument
```


Keyword lists are important because they have three special characteristics:

- Keys must be **atoms**.

- Keys are **ordered**, as specified by the developer.

- Keys can be given **more than once**

For example, keyword lists are useful in database queries because we can have the same key in different positions.

```elixir
db.find_user([where: age > 18, where: subscribed == true])
```

If we are using a map instead, we cannot have `where` twice.
